# fotopia
Some tools to make sense of a chaotic and disorganised photo archive, and a web app that will store them

# The apps
This repo is divided up into the separate projects
- fotopia-gathering
- fotopia-web-app

## fotopia-gathering
A collection of node scripts for sorting through a phot archive and working out what is good.

- point to a directory
- determine which images are trash based on criteria
- do a visual check that the rejected images are ok 
- mark the ones that are saved TODO
- modify the list with manual updates and submit all the photos to fotopia-web-app TODO

## fotopia-web-app
- create hosted instance where we upload the gathered photos WIP
